        <h4>Challenges:</h4>
        <p>I did not feel like there was a particularly challenging part to this assignment.</p>

        <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
        <p>I learned that HTML files should describe what type of document it is at the top. The rest was a refresher.</p>

        <h4>Most Helpful Resource:</h4>
        <p>
            The most helpful resource for this assignment was Ed Discussion 
            because I was confused about the reference Campuswire, and someone 
            else had already posted about it and got the issue resolved.
